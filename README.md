# üß™ Homelab Configuration 

## **This repo has been replaced by [Homelab](https://github.com/ushiradineth/homelab)**

## About

- This repository consists of code that helps me boot up my 'home server' from scratch with a few simple commands.
- My motivation for this is due to my old laptop failing beyond repair at times which requires me to restart configuration from the beginning.

## üîß Stack

- NixOS
- Ansible
- Docker
- Kubernetes

## üìÇ Ansible Documentation

### üìñ Playbooks

- nixos

  - Purpose: To generate and build the NixOS configuration.
  - Command: `ansible-playbook -i user@host, nixos.yml --ask-become-pass`
  - Note: --ask-become-pass is required as this playbook needs to build and update the OS.

- dotfiles

  - Purpose: To pull and stow dotfiles.
  - Command: `ansible-playbook -i user@host, dotfiles.yml --ask-become-pass`
  - Note: --ask-become-pass is required as this playbook creates the dotfiles for the root user aswell.

- docker

  - Purpose: To create docker configuration and deploy the services.
  - Command: `ansible-playbook -i user@host, docker.yml`
  - Note:
    - This playbook will create a .env file and return early if the .env file is not found on the remote machine, ensure that this is filled as needed.
    - This playbook will not restart services when environment variables change as this does not keep track of them, restart the services manually if the environment variables do change.

### üë∑ Roles

- ssh_port

  - Check if the default SSH port is changed to a custom one.
  - Set the SSH Port to the port which the script can connect to successfully.
  - Throw an error if both default and custom SSH ports fails.

- nixos

  - Generate configuration.nix file with the variables.
  - Build and switch to the new configuration if the configuration.nix file is changed.

- dotfiles

  - Clone or Pull the dotfiles repository into the given directory.
  - Stow the files if the dotfiles are changed.

- docker

  - Copy the compose file from the local directory to the remote directory.
  - Deploy the service(s) defined in the compose file.

## NixOS Installation Flow

- Download the latest NixOS Minimal ISO from the [NixOS website](https://nixos.org/download/).
- Create a bootable USB drive with the ISO file using a tool like [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).
- Follow the instructions on the [NixOS website](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation).
- Edit the configuration.nix file to have the following changes:
    - `services.openssh.settings.PermitRootLogin = "yes"`
    - Add `python3` to the `environment.systemPackages` list.
- Run `nixos-rebuild switch` to update the configuration.
- Run `ansible-playbook -i root@ip, nixos.yml --ask-pass --ask-become-pass`
- Reboot the system.
